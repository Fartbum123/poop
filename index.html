      <p><b>What problem does your prototype solve? Why is it important?</b>It'll solve your problem of forgetting to lock your doors</p>
      <p><b>Who will use this device? How will it benefit them?</b>Anyone can use this device and it'll benefit those who usually forget to lock their doors after leaving or entering their house.</p>
      <p><b>What are the main features of your prototype? How do they address the identified need?</b>A servo motor will be added as a lock. It'll start at 90 degrees acting as a lock behind the door. Once the buttons have been clicked, the servo  motor will turn 90 degrees upright and it'll allow for the door to open. After a couple of seconds, the servo motor will automatically</p>

This will stop all noise and then the servo motor will turn 90 degrees while playing a new sound. Once the new sound finishes, after 5 seconds, the servo motor will automatically rotate 90 back as the door lock. </figcaption>
